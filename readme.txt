Functionality to be added

The app must have the following functionalities

When an unauthenticated user tries to access the Cart Route, then the page should be navigated to Login Route

Following are the features to be implemented

Feature 1

When an authenticated user tries to add the same product multiple times
The quantity of the product should be updated accordingly, and the count of the cart items in the header should be remained same
Feature 2

The total amount and number of items in the cart should be displayed in the Cart Route
Feature 3

In each cart item in the cart
When the plus icon is clicked, then the quantity of the product should be incremented by one
When the minus icon is clicked, then the quantity of the product should be decremented by one
When the quantity of the product is one and the minus icon is clicked, then the respective product should be removed from the cart
Based on the quantity of the product, the product price and the Cart Summary, i.e the total cost should be updated accordingly
Feature 4

When an authenticated user clicks on the remove button, cart item should be removed from the cart list
Feature 5

When an authenticated user clicks on the Remove All button, all the cart items should be removed from the cart and Empty Cart View should be displayed
The CartContext has an object as a value with the following properties

incrementCartItemQuantity 
this method increases the quantity of a product in the cartList
decrementCartItemQuantity 
this method decreases the quantity of a product in the cartList
